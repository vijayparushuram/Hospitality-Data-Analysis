# Hospitality Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking and hospitality data using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Jupyter Notebook** within **PyCharm Professional**. The objective is to clean, process, and analyze raw booking data to uncover meaningful insights related to revenue, occupancy, room categories, and guest booking behavior.

The project closely simulates a **real-world hospitality analytics use case** and highlights practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), KPI analysis, and business-focused insight generation.

## 📊 Key Insights & Analysis

This analysis provides meaningful insights relevant to hospitality and hotel operations:

* **Revenue Analysis** by room category (RT1, RT2, RT3, RT4)
* **Occupancy Trends** to identify seasonal peaks and low-demand periods
* **Guest Booking Behavior**, including advance vs last-minute bookings
* **Cancellation Risk Analysis** to highlight high-risk booking segments
* **Outlier Detection** in revenue, length of stay, and booking lead time
* **Data Quality Assessment** highlighting missing or inconsistent values
* **Operational KPIs**:

  * Average length of stay
  * Revenue per booking
  * Booking lead time patterns

---
