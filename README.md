# Hospitality-Data-Analysis

Project 1: Hospitality Data Analysis
This project analyzes hospitality (hotel) booking data using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook inside PyCharm. The goal is to clean, process, and analyze booking data to understand trends such as revenue, occupancy, room categories, and guest booking behavior.

📊 Key Insights
This project provides actionable insights for hospitality and hotel management teams. Below are some of the key data-driven observations:
•	Revenue trends by room category (RT1, RT2, RT3, RT4, etc.)
•	Occupancy analysis to understand seasonal peaks and low-demand periods
•	Guest booking patterns, including advance bookings and last minute trends
•	Cancellation analysis to identify high risk booking segments
•	Outlier detection in revenue, stay duration, and booking lead time
•	Data quality assessment, highlighting missing or inconsistent fields
•	Operational KPIs, such as average stay length and revenue per booking
These insights can support business decisions, revenue management, performance tracking, and forecasting.
